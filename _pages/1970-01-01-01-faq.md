    content: |
      We strive to set the standard on corportate citizenship by embodying our values globally, not just for our investors, members, C-Levels, or employees, but even our competitors and those who do not directly use our services.

    question: Why are payments non-refundable?
    answer: We believe in transparency and setting expectations up front. Accepting online payments legally and responsibly has an associated cost, and because we wish to provide the best value to our members we don't artificially inflate prices to cover the costs of dealing with the masses. Instead, to eliminate the cost of time spent catering to tourists who are unready or unwilling to join our community we simply filter out that population so we may focus our attention on catering to members who understand and respect the value of time.
