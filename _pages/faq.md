    heading: Vision
    content: |
      We strive to set the standard on corportate citizenship by embodying our values globally, not just for our investors, members, C-Levels, or employees, but even our competitors and those who do not directly use our services.
      
      The reason the world is filled with ever degrading services at ever increasing costs is that people often don't have access to or know about alternatives... we are the alternative and wish to inspire others by example.
      
      We imagine a future where companies compete on merit of providing the best value.

    question: What services do you offer?
    answer: Our primary product, the "Virtual PBX" for lack of a better name, is a fully managed cloud hosted VoIP server used by providers of healthcare and auxiliary services. Stated more simply, we're a phone company for Dentists, Orthodontists, and DSOs, except that we're a technology company not a traditional TelCo.

    question: What's the difference between your service and other Telephone or VoIP providers?
    answer: We don't try to be everything for everyone, which is how we deliver the essential services businesses need at price points competitors cannot fathom. By not trying to be a drop in replacement for traditional phones we're avoiding the regulatory red tape and costs associated with emergency services, dial tones, and most of all unneccessary and outdated taxes which other service providers simply inflate before passing on to their customers.

    question: Why are payments non-refundable?
    answer: We believe in transparency and setting expectations up front. Accepting online payments legally and responsibly has an associated cost, and because we wish to provide the best value to our members we don't artificially inflate prices to cover the costs of dealing with the masses. Instead, to eliminate the cost of time spent catering to tourists who are unready or unwilling to join our community we simply filter out that population so we may focus our attention on members who understand and respect the value of time.
