Integrated Solutions is simply audocious: A company set to succeed by sheer virtue. 
Our competetive advantage is that we take pride in our work and values. 
We believe in goodness, and wish to facilitate a better world through the manifestations of our values.

While most our experience is in the healthcare and telecommunications industries we're purists and as such ready to tacle technical challenges wherever they arise. 
To the pure, all things are pure. Just as a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, 
a bucket of transistors will behave roughly the same in a mainframe, the 'cloud', or as the brains of a self-driving automobile assuming relevant paramaters are controlled.

We're not your typical consulting firm or solutions provider, [buy some time to speak with an expert](https://link.waveapps.com/rn8j9w-jh4qyj), 
skip the consulting to start playing with a [self-service package](https://link.waveapps.com/5uv7c7-yftq6g), 
or jump over to our 24/7 self-service [Domain Name and Cloud Hosting store](https://sdxdomains.com) for your website needs. 
We won't try to collect your data or sell you anything, in fact you won't even hear from us until after you've bought some [time](https://link.waveapps.com/rn8j9w-jh4qyj).
