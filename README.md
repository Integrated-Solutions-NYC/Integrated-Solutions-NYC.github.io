# Integrated Solutions Website

Our website is based on themes from:
'''
Author: BootstrapMade.com
Author URL: https://bootstrapmade.com

# Our Plan:

In an effort to master Jekyll we're converting the bootstrap themes to Jekyll templated sites and using our own homepage as a proof of concept! The plan is really quite simple, at least simple said, hopefully simply done :fingerscrossed: but we're not holding our breath as nothing is ever as simple as it seems at first glance.

1. Refactor such that a change in CSS filename alone may be used to cycle themes
2. Use meaningful, common element names and IDs such that HTML need not be changed between themes
3. Sections each have their own layout files, and themes may have contributions to sections, devise a system to map sections to themes to honor #1
