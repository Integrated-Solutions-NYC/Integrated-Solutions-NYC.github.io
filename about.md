        <p>
        Integrated Solutions is simply audocious: A company set to succeed by sheer virtue. 
        Our competetive advantage is that we take pride in our work and values. 
        We believe in goodness, and wish to facilitate a better world through the manifestations of our values.
        While most our experience is in the healthcare and telecommunications industries we're purists and as such ready to tacle technical challenges wherever they arise. 
        To the pure, all things are pure. Just as a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, 
        a bucket of transistors will behave roughly the same in a mainframe, the 'cloud', or as the brains of a self-driving automobile assuming relevant paramaters are controlled.
